        <div class="steps">
            <ul>
                <li>Here are some ways you can practice meditation on your own, whenever you choose:</li>

                <li>Breathe deeply. This is good for beginners because breathing is a natural function.</li>

                <li>Focus all your attention on your breathing. Feel your breath and listen to it as you inhale and
                    exhale
                    through your nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your mind wanders, gently return your focus
                    to your
                    breathing.</li>

                <li>Scan your body. When using this technique, focus attention on each part of your body. Become aware
                    of how
                    your body feels. That might be pain, tension, warmth or relaxation.</li>

                <li>Mix body scanning with breathing exercises and think about breathing heat or relaxation into and out
                    of the
                    parts of your body.</li>

                <li>Repeat a mantra. You can create your own mantra. It can be religious or not. Examples of religious
                    mantras
                    include the Jesus Prayer in the Christian tradition, the holy name of God in Judaism, or the om
                    mantra of
                    Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions.
                    Walk and meditate. Meditating while walking is a good and healthy way to relax. You can use this
                    technique
                    anywhere you're walking, such as in a forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall.</li>

                <li>When you use this method, slow your walking pace so that you can focus on each movement of your legs
                    or
                    feet. Don't focus on where you're going. Focus on your legs and feet. Repeat action words in your
                    mind such
                    as "lifting," "moving" and "placing" as you lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your
                    foot on the
                    ground. Focus on the sights, sounds and smells around you.</li>

                <li>Pray. Prayer is the best known and most widely used type of meditation. Spoken and written prayers
                    are found
                    in most faith traditions.</li>

                <li>You can pray using your own words or read prayers written by others. Check the self-help section of
                    your
                    local bookstore for examples. Talk with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other spiritual leader about
                    possible
                    resources.</li>

                <li>Read and reflect. Many people report that they benefit from reading poems or sacred texts and taking
                    a few
                    moments to think about their meaning.</li>

                <li>You also can listen to sacred music, spoken words, or any music that relaxes or inspires you. You
                    may want
                    to write your thoughts in a journal or discuss them with a friend or spiritual leader.</li>

                <li>Focus your love and kindness. In this type of meditation, you think of others with feelings of love,
                    compassion and kindness. This can help increase how connected you feel to others.</li>
